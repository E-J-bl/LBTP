Protocol for low and variable bandwidth data transfer across a mesh of esp32.

The project also contains a custom built emulator fully in python for the development of the high level ideas. 
The emulator supports: manual memory editing; GPIO; interupts; and creating simulated mesh networks (star networks can be made using custom implementations and by configurating one node to act in a different way). 
the emulator is not an emulator of an esp32 but is for network protocol dev in a langauge tha is easier to work with.
